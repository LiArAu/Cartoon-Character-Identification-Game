## General info
This is a Cartoon Character Identification Game. There are four main menus: `Start to Play`, `About the Game`, `Settings` and `Candy Rank`. `Start to Play` will lead you to the game, and you need to enter your name before start to play. For each question, you will have a chance to ask for a clue, otherwise you can enter the answer and click `Next`. In `About the Game`, you will see a brief introduction for the game, and have a chance to contribute to the game by adding new questions. In `Settings`, you can change the frame color as your preference. In `Candy Rank`, you will see all the players and how many candies they have.

## Author's Note

This game is adapted from a brand identification game. I believe that no matter how old I am, I will always love cartoons. And I appreciate all the cartoon characters that taught me integrity, honesty, friendship, confidence and love.
